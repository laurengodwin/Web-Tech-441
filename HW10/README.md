I got part of it to work. At one point it was popping up and now it doesn't show on my end. I can't figure out why but I created a bunch of little marching dudes.
I was actually quite proud of myself but now they don't appear :(
<h2>UPDATE</h2>
Turns out my little marching dudes were there but my computer hadn't fully loaded. Makes me feel relieved that something finally shows up this semester! I couldn't figure out how to make something follow my mouse or get things to collide with one another.
