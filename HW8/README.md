This week was so so challenging for me. One moment I had a picture working but it was HUGE so I tried to down size it. Once I did that, it disappeared. I put the size back to where it was orginally
and then I started messing around with the rest of my code to get other things working. Then the picture was gone.
And now I have no idea how to get it back.
