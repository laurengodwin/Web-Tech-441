<h1>Homework Week 6</h1>
<p>https://laurengodwin.github.io/Web-Tech-441/  </p>
<p>I had a hectic week last week, so therefore I did not complete week 5 homework.
<br>Finally got my codes to work. I basically had to make a whole new repository because I accidentally deleted my folder :(
  <br>Now that I got it back up and running, I was able to get the the section where my matching food items would pop up however those are not going through and I don't know why.</p>
  <p>I am sure it is something simple but due to lack of time, I will have to figure it out later.<br> This coding is getting harder and harder and I am struggling with getting little things to work properly.</p>
  <p>I am hoping this week I do a better job of figuring all the homework out. I also hope the examples are more helpful this time.</p>
