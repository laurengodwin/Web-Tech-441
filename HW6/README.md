<h1>Homework Week 6</h1>
<p>https://laurengodwin.github.io/Web-Tech-441/  </p>
<p>I had a hectic week last week, so therefore I did not complete week 5 homework.
<br>Trying to catch is a little hard but I am having the same problem from the beginning.<br>
I can't figure out how to get my "HW-6" link to work. It just shows up as "Error: 404...."
<br>I always seem to miss one small detail that doesn't allow my code to work.<p>
