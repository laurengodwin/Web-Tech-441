<h1>Homework Week 3</h1>
<p>https://laurengodwin.github.io/MART-441/</p>
<h2>This week was full of trial and errors.</h2>
<br>
<br>
<p>I really wish there was a main example to go off because I was quite confused for most of the project.
<br>I had to look at my classmates already submitted work to get an idea of what to do.
<br>I also struggle with linking files and other html pages together so that my overall Live Site functions...as you can clearly see my Live Site for this weeks HW does not work. I can't figure out why. I am sure its something simple but my brain can't figure it out.</p>
