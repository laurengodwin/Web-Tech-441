well I definitely couldn't figure out this past weeks homework. I tried so many things to make it work but could only do the basic visuals.
I had a very busy week outside of school that distracted me a lot from focusing on the homework.
I am bummed that I didn't put more effort into this week but I can always fiddle with it more later.
