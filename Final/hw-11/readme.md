<h2> Homework 11</h2>

<p> This week I worked on an object based program designed to create a set amount of moving figures using arrays and classes. For my project I combined both examples and made them my own. </p>
<p>I had a lot of fun with this homework and it was cool to see my progress throughout it.</p>
