Okay, I have been working on this since we got the assignment (which typically I procrastinate). However, knowing that
I am not very good at getting things to work, I really wanted to out-do myself and get my final portfolio to actually work.
I used a bootstrap template that I had from a previous class when I was a freshman. 
Using the bootstrap template I then was able to add different links to some of the projects I have created for other classes.
Each link you click on allows you to see where the project was created and a little summary about it.
I also created an about page but some of the images are covering the words and I don't know how to fix that. I tried everything I could think of 
and it wouldn't work.
<p>
I included my current resume on there (if I were to use this professionally). Inside my resume link, is a link to my LinkedIn and 
that is supposed to go to my profile but it was only bringing me to the login site. Not sure how to fix that either.
</p> 
If I use this professionally I would like to add more content to it (especially that I know how to now) but I figured 8 links would be good to start off with.
I worked my ass off to actually get this to work and flow properly. I am really hoping that it is visible on your end when grading. I did check to see if it would work on another computer and it did.
