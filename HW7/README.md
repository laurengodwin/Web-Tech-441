This weeks matieral was a lot easier for me to understand. However, like always I CANNOT get my links to work between my live
site (index.html) and my HW7.html. It pops up as 404 error. I fixed it on my last couple assignments
but I don't remember how I fixed those. 
Update as of March 4th, at 10:48pm. My link now works but the images do not :(
It does randomly rotate but just the image tags like (images/mug.jpg). Then for the rest of the info for the pictures, those show up funky. I have tried and tried this whole week to try to get this to work but I can't so at least part of my code works...right?
<br> Why is it that each week parts of my code works but then I can never seem to get it 100% complete? It is super frustrating.
