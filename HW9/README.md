<h1>JSON/AJAX/JQUERY is hard...</h1>
Wow...these past 3 weeks were hard for me. As you can tell from my non working homework that I
struggled with this assignment. This whole semester has been confusing but that was the cherry
on top. I have no clue what I was doing when I was attempting the assignment. I watched all the videos and 
read multiple sources for help but my brain could not grasp this. I got my buttons to work but that is it. 
I am sure I missed a whole area as to why my stuff didn't work but at this point I am confusing myself more trying
to figure it out.
